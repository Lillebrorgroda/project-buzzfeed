        <h1>"What Do Killer Whales Want? </h1>
        <h2>Scientists Say ‘It’s Complicated’</h2>
        <p>1. Orcas Have Complex Social Structures – Killer whales live in tight-knit matriarchal pods with unique
            cultures, dialects, and hunting techniques passed down through generations. Some pods even have alliances
            and rivalries, making their social lives surprisingly intricate.</p>
        <p>2. They Might Be Seeking Revenge – Recent incidents of orcas attacking and sinking boats, particularly around
            the Iberian Peninsula, have led scientists to speculate whether they're acting out of learned behavior,
            stress, or even a form of revenge for past encounters with humans.</p>
        <p>3. Orcas Play With Their Food—Even Great White Sharks – These apex predators are known to flip sharks upside
            down to induce tonic immobility (a temporary paralysis), then eat only their nutrient-rich livers. It's a
            level of strategy that suggests more than just survival instincts at play.</P>
        <p>4. They Have Distinct Personalities – Just like humans, individual orcas have unique personalities. Some are
            playful, some are aggressive, and some are more independent. Scientists believe their decision-making is
            influenced by experience, learning, and social bonds.</p>
        <P>5. They Can Teach Each Other New Behaviors – Orcas are known for cultural transmission—teaching one another
            new skills and habits. Whether it’s the boat-ramming trend seen in Iberian orcas or the wave-washing
            technique used by Antarctic pods to hunt seals, these behaviors spread among groups like viral trends.</p>
        <h4>So, what do killer whales want? That depends on which one you ask! 🐋</h4>
